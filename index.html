					<p>
					I am a 28 year old mother of one, beach loving baby. I fancy myself as an artist, writer, and clean water activist. I hope one say to help push the envelope towards renewable energy sources and ensure clean water for future generations through web development.
					Sound a little crazy? Here's some food for <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-web-developer-save-a-country">thought.</a></p>
					<p>
					Speaking of food, I make a mean coconut curry! Some other fun facts about me are: I love languages, but am a master to none.
					I collect Labbits, and put Sriracha on everything! One guilty pleasure is that I actually enjoy listeing to christmas music when it plays 24/7 on the radio (but I'll never admit it).
					I have lived on a hand full of islands in the US including Manhattan. I have never been to California, but I have traveled to Poland, France, and London.</p> 
					<p>Can you guess the other islands? Here's a hint: They are all located on the East Coast.
